# frontend-UI

### GOALS & INTENSION

This project aims to develop my frontend development skills and familiarize the libraries that are fundamental to JavaScript software development.
I plan to build this project from a single frontend page to a fullstack website that contains frontend, backend, and database as well.
What's more, I expect it is a project that can display my JavaScript skills, so the backend will be built in NodeJS.

### PROGRESS

- [x] VERSION 1: a single page that consists of fundamental styles.
- [ ] VERSION 2: use Nextjs to router pages and get data from database.(**IS WORKING**)
- [ ] VERSION 3: request to a server and render pages through REST API.
